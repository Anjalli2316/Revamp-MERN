    <p style="font: size 100px;"> Here I am going to use a few character entities that are most commonly found in almost every website we tend to visit.<br>
         The first one is &copy;,which is used to indicate copyright information.<br> 
         The second one is the &trade;,which is  used next to a trademarked brand name or product.<br> 
         The next one would be &amp;, This is used when you want to display an actual ampersand symbol rather than 
         using it as a part of another entity or URL encoding. </p>
